assemblySimulator
=================

Assembly simulator that uses 16 bit instruction. It is just a simple Java simulator for simulating the assembly instructions. I will soon upload documentation of working of this simulator. This simulator needs GUI and I am also planning to make this completely using javascript. Thanks -Minesh
